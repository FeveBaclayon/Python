    "Write Python classes Vehicle, Car, and Truck where:\n",
    "Each has attributes: color, mileage, and fuel_liters.\n",
    "Method drive(km, km_per_liter) increases mileage and decreases fuel. Fuel cannot go below zero.\n",
    "Method refuel(liters) adds to fuel_liters.\n",
    "Truck overrides drive() to be less fuel efficient (e.g., consumes 20% more fuel).\n",

    "# Critique\n",
    "Correctness:\n",
    "Implements inheritance and overriding correctly. Truckâ€™s drive consumes more fuel, fulfilling override requirement. Fuel never goes below zero. Works for both Car and Truck.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity:\n",
    "All methods run in O(1) time and use O(1) space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness:\n",
    "Could add input validation (e.g., non-negative km or liters). No error handling for bad inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability:\n",
    "Code is clear and PEP 8 compliant. Adding docstrings and comments would further improve clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faithfulness:\n",
    "Demonstrates inheritance, method overriding, and instance behavior differences exactly as required."
